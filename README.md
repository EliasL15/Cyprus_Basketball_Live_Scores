# Cyprus Basketball Live Scores

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to scrape and display live basketball scores for Cyprus Basketball games. Leveraging Playwright, the application retrieves real-time data and updates scores dynamically. It was developed to address the lack of responsiveness on the official Cyprus Basketball Federation website, which makes it difficult to access game scores on mobile devices. The decision to use web scraping was driven by the absence of an available API, ensuring that users can stay updated with game scores seamlessly and on-the-go.

## Features

- Displays live scores for Cyprus Basketball games.
- Automatically updates the scores every 10 seconds.
- Provides links to detailed game statistics.
